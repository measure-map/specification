      "description": "Any unique string to identify this Measure object. Unique, here, means that the string cannot be used as ID for another object that forms part of the same MeasureMap. The 'next' array may use these IDs to refer to other Measures. Additionally, IDs can prove useful in cross-relating between MeasureMaps relating to different editions of the same piece, e.g. by assigning identical IDs for measures that are identical across the two. The ID could be, for instance, human-readable form (e.g., the 'count' value converted to a string) or a random string (often the case in MEI scores).",
